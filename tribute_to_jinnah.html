      <div>
        <ul class="list-group">
          <li class="list-group-item">Muhammad Ali Jinnah (born Mahomedali Jinnahbhai; 25 December 1876 – 11 September 1948) was a lawyer, politician,
            and the founder of Pakistan</li>
          <li class="list-group-item">Jinnah served as the leader of the All-India Muslim League</li>
          <li class="list-group-item">Born at Wazir Mansion in Karachi</li>
          <li class="list-group-item">By 1940, Jinnah had come to believe that Muslims of the Indian subcontinent should have their own state.</li>
          <li class="list-group-item">Muslim League, led by Jinnah, passed the Lahore Resolution, demanding a separate nation</li>
          <li class="list-group-item">In 1906 he joined the Congress and started participating in Indian Independence movement. He strongly opposed separate
            electorate for Muslims and was elected to the Imperial Legislative Council as Bombay's Muslim representative
            in 1909</li>
          <li class="list-group-item">In 1912, he attended a meeting of Muslim League and a year later joined the party while still remaining affiliated
            to the Congress and tried his best to bring the Congress and the League together.</li>
          <li class="list-group-item">In 1913, he was a member of the delegation sent to England on behalf of Congress, led by Gokhale. He was hailed
            as an ambassador of Hindu-Muslim unity by the Congress leaders and was immensely admired for his liberal ideologies.</li>
          <li class="list-group-item">In 1916, while he served as the president of Muslim League, the Congress and the League signed the ‘Lucknow Pact’,
            according to which the quotas were to be allocated to Muslims and Hindus regarding representation in the Indian
            provinces. The same year he also played a key role in establishing the Home Rule League.</li>
          <li class="list-group-item">In 1923, he was elected as Muslim representative for Bombay in the Central Legislative Assembly. He was extremely
            effective as a parliamentarian and also started working with the Swaraj Party.</li>
          <li class="list-group-item">By 1926, things started to fall apart between the congress and Jinnah and he started supporting separate electorates
            for Muslims. He, however, continued to believe Muslim tradition and rights did not have any threats under united
            India.
          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item">In 1947 Lord Mountbatten was sent to India by Clement Attlee administration. Mountbatten was entrusted the responsibility
            of handing over the powers to India and draw the outlines for a separate state of Pakistan.</li>
          <li class="list-group-item">On 14th August, 1947 Jinna’s envisioned state of Pakistan came into existence and he was made the Governor General
            of the newly formed Muslim state.</li>
          <li class="list-group-item">Jinnah died a year after partition and didn’t have too much of a role to play in the formative years of Pakistan
            due to his declining health</li>
          <li class="list-group-item">In 1925, to honor his contributions as a legislator, he was offered a knighthood by Lord Reading, which he rejected
            saying "I prefer to be plain Mr. Jinnah”.</li>
          <li class="list-group-item">He was sworn as the First Governor General of the state of Pakistan a day after its creation.</li>
